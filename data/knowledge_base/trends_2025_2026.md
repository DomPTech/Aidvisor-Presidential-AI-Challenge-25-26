# Natural Disaster Trends and Challenges (2025-2026)

## Overview
The period of 2025-2026 is marked by an escalation in climate-driven events, with increased frequency and intensity across cyclones, floods, and wildfires. Global insured losses in 2025 exceeded $120 billion.

## Key Trends
- **Increased Devastation**: Economic damages have nearly doubled compared to previous years, despite stable event frequency, indicating higher devastation per incident.
- **Shifting Patterns**: Tornadoes are moving into less prepared regions. Billion-dollar disasters are occurring year-round rather than being hazard-specific or seasonal.
- **Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**: Power, water, and transportation infrastructure are increasingly failing as they weren't designed for current climate extremes.
- **Equity in Operations**: Emergency management is integrating equity into operational decisions to ensure vulnerable populations are not left behind.

## Technological Shifts
- **AI Integration**: Next-generation AI is being used for real-time translation, damage assessment, and situational awareness.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Satellite data and IoT sensors (e.g., for landslide prevention) are becoming standard.
- **Training**: VR simulations are increasingly used for high-fidelity disaster responder training.
