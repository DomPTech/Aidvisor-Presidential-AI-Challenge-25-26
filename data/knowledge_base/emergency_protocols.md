# Emergency Protocols and Preparedness (2025-2026)

## Personal and Family Preparedness
"National Preparedness Month" (September 2025) emphasizes that "Preparedness Starts at Home."

### Essential Steps
1. **Know Your Risks**: Understand local hazards (floods, fires, etc.).
2. **Create a Plan**: Designate a family communication plan and an out-of-area contact.
3. **Build Kits**: 
   - **Go-Kit**: 3 days of supplies (water, snacks, meds, flashlight, first aid, power bank) for evacuation.
   - **Stay-at-Home Kit**: 2 weeks of food/water and 1 month of medications.
4. **Plan for Pets**: Ensure you have evacuation plans for animals.

## Emergency Actions
- **Evacuation**: Follow local orders immediately. Have multiple routes planned.
- **Communication**: Use text instead of calls to keep lines open for emergencies.
- **Post-Disaster**: Clearly define roles for community partners and plan for debris management early.

## Community Resilience
- **Microgrids**: communities are developing independent energy grids for power resilience.
- **Early Warning Systems**: Localized apps and floating homes are becoming more common in flood-prone areas.
